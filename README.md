# FreeCodeCamp-React
A hub for all the projects worked on during the FreeCodeCamp React Course. This course was originally [taught on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact), but I am taking it on YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8). I wanted to have these projects and work locally, so that I could keep a record of them on my GitHub. 

<!-- For the one with the numbers, the . after the number is ignored. -->

## Guided Course Projects
_The following are all projects that the course guides me through._
### 01. Static Webpage
- [Link to the Repo](https://github.com/rperry99/01_Static-Page)
- There is no live demo for this. In trying to make it work, I think I messed something up in the files. I am trying to fix this, and get the live version up and running.
- A static webpage using react.
- This is a very simple project, mainly just to get used to using react.
- This one was created with `npm create vite@latest`, and is an actual react project, not using a CDN.
- This project is **not** responsive, and was not meant to be. The focus was on using react, not creaing a responsive website.

### 02. Air BNB Clone
- [Link to the Repo](https://github.com/rperry99/02_Air-BNB-Clone)
- [Link to the Demo](https://rperry99.github.io/02_Air-BNB-Clone/)
- A very simple recreation of an experience from Air BNB's website.
- This project introduces:
  - Props
  - Creating components form an array of data
- This project is **not** responsive, and was not meant to be. The focus was on using react, not creaing a responsive website.

## Solo Projects
_The following are projects that the course gives, where there is no guidance on completing it. All code is my own code._
### 01. Digital Business Card
- [Link to the Repo](https://github.com/rperry99/solo-01_digital-business-card)
- [Link to the Demo](https://rperry99.github.io/solo-01_digital-business-card/)
- A static webpage, that acts as a digital business card.
- The course provided a Figma file of the basic design, and I used my own photo and information to complete the project.
- Somewhat over-engineered, by using multiple components and style sheets. This was on purpose, for the purpose of practice, not so much doing "best practices".
- This project is **not** responsive, and was not meant to be. The focus was on using react, not creaing a responsive website.

### 02. Joke Cards
- [Link to the Repo](https://github.com/rperry99/solo-02_joke-cards)
- [Link to the Demo](https://rperry99.github.io/solo-02_joke-cards/)
- A static webpage that is just some cards with puns on them.
- This project was meant to reinforce how to use props.
- Each card uses different props to populate the information.
- This project is **not** responsive, and was not meant to be. The focus was on using react, not creaing a responsive website.

### 03. Travel Journal
- [Link to the Repo](https://github.com/rperry99/solo-03_travel-journal)
- [Link to the Demo](https://rperry99.github.io/solo-03_travel-journal/)
- A static webpage of some of my recent travels.
- This poroject was meant to reinforce how to use props, `.map`, and dynamically create component instances though the use of a separate JS file with the data for each component.
- This project is **not** responsive, and was not meant to be. The focus was on using react, not creaing a responsive website.

## Other Related Repos
### React Playground
- [Link to the Repo](https://github.com/rperry99/react-fcc-1)
- This was more or less just a way to mess around with React.
- Wasn't created with `create-react-app` or anything like that. It used the CDN versions of React, as well as Babel.
- I explored ways to create components by using JSX.

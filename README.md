# FreeCodeCamp-React
A hub for all the projects worked on during the FreeCodeCamp React Course. This course was originally [taught on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact), but I am taking it on YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8). I wanted to have these projects and work locally, so that I could keep a record of them on my GitHub.

### React Playground
- [Link to the Repo](https://github.com/rperry99/react-fcc-1)
- This was more or less just a way to mess around with React.
- Wasn't created with `create-react-app` or anything like that. It used the CDN versions of React, as well as Babel.
- I explored ways to create components by using JSX.

## Projects
### 01. Static Webpage

- A static webpage using react.
- This is a very simple project, mainly just to get used to using react.
